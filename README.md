# 🎓 Student Score Prediction: Linear Regression

This project addresses **Task 1: Student Score Prediction** from the machine learning internship.

The goal is to build a basic **Linear Regression** model to predict a student's final exam score based on their study hours using the Mall Customer Dataset.

## 🚀 What's Included:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, basic visualization, and outlier analysis (IQR/Z-score).
* **Model Training:** Implementing and training a single-feature Linear Regression model.
* **Evaluation:** Calculating and reporting performance using MAE and R-squared.
* **Bonus Exploration:** Comparison with Polynomial Regression for potential non-linear data modeling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:

* Python
* Pandas, Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

## 📍 File:

* `student_data.csv`
* `Student_Score_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb` (Google Colab file)
